**Health Monitoring Application in C++**

This application will monitor a user's health information over time, including heart rate, activity level, and sleeping habits. It will provide tailored advice and insights based on the data collected.

### Application Structure

The application will consist of the following modules:

1.  **Data Collector**: Responsible for collecting data from external sensors or user inputs.
2.  **Data Analyzer**: Analyzes the collected data to determine patterns and provide recommendations.
3.  **Data Storage**: Stores the user's health data for future references.
4.  **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input data and view recommendations.

### Explanation

This application consists of four modules: Data Collector, Data Analyzer, Data Storage, and User Interface.

1.  The Data Collector module is responsible for collecting health data from the user, including heart rate, activity level, and sleep hours.
2.  The Data Analyzer module analyzes the collected data to determine patterns and provide recommendations.
3.  The Data Storage module stores the user's health data in a file for future references.
4.  The User Interface module provides a user-friendly interface for users to input data and view recommendations.

The application uses a `HealthData` struct to store the user's health data, which includes date, heart rate, activity level, and sleep hours.

In the `main` function, the application displays a menu for the user to choose from. Based on the user's choice, the application either collects health data, views recommendations, or exits.

### Example Use Case

Here's an example use case:

1.  The user runs the application and chooses to input health data.
2.  The user is prompted to enter the date, heart rate, activity level, and sleep hours.
3.  The user enters the data, and it is stored in a file.
4.  The user chooses to view recommendations.
5.  The application analyzes the collected data and displays recommendations based on the patterns found.

Note: This is a basic implementation and may need to be modified to suit specific requirements. Additionally, the application does not handle errors or exceptions, which should be added in a real-world implementation.
